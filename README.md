# üí∞ Kotlin Bank App

A beginner-friendly **end-to-end Kotlin + Android MVVM** project to simulate a **basic banking system**. The app demonstrates core Android development skills and progresses toward Clean Architecture, Dependency Injection, and modern libraries.

---

## üöÄ Problem Statement

**Build a mobile banking app** that allows users to:

- üîê Login (no real auth initially)
- üíµ Add money to their account
- üí∏ Withdraw funds
- üîÅ Transfer to another existing account
- üßæ View transaction history

The app will start with **offline-only functionality** using **Room DB**, then extend to online sync, cloud auth, testing, and advanced architecture.
